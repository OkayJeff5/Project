This is a Blackjack game I create through Python, try to run this in Jupyter notebook to get the best experience. 

There are two file in this folder:
1. First one is the step by step tutorial. It explain how the code work step by step. You can also run each code one by one and play the game in the end.
2. Second one is the complete game. You can just run once and start the game!
